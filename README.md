## What is MapReader?

MapReader is an end-to-end computer vision (CV) pipeline for exploring and analyzing images at scale. 

MapReader was developed in the [Living with Machines](https://livingwithmachines.ac.uk/) project to analyze large collections of historical maps but is a _**generalisable**_ computer vision pipeline which can be applied to _**any images**_ in a wide variety of domains. See [Gallery](#gallery) for some examples.

Refer to each tutorial/example in the [use cases](#use-cases) section for more details on MapReader's relevant functionalities for [<ins>non-geospatial</ins>](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/MapReader/tree/main/examples/non-geospatial) and [<ins>geospatial</ins>](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/MapReader/tree/main/examples/geospatial) images.

## Overview

MapReader is a groundbreaking interdisciplinary tool that emerged from a specific set of geospatial historical research questions. It was inspired by methods in biomedical imaging and geographic information science, which were adapted for annotation and use by historians, for example in [JVC](https://doi.org/10.1093/jvcult/vcab009) and [MapReader](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15592) papers. The success of the tool subsequently generated interest from plant phenotype researchers working with large image datasets, and so MapReader is an example of cross-pollination between the humanities and the sciences made possible by reproducible data science.

MapReader has two main components: preprocessing/annotation and training/inference as shown in this figure:

        alt="MapReader pipeline" width="70%" align="center">
</p>

It provides a set of tools to:

- **load** images or maps stored locally or **retrieve** maps via web-servers (e.g., tileservers which can be used to retrieve maps from OpenStreetMap (OSM), the National Library of Scotland (NLS), or elsewhere). :warning: Refer to the [credits and re-use terms](#credits-and-re-use-terms) section if you are using digitized maps or metadata provided by NLS. 
- **preprocess** images or maps (e.g., divide them into patches, resampling the images, removing borders outside the neatline or reprojecting the map).
- annotate images or maps or their patches (i.e. slices of an image or map) using an **interactive annotation tool**.
- **train, fine-tune, and evaluate** various CV models.
- **predict** labels (i.e., model inference) on large sets of images or maps.
- Other functionalities include:
    - various **plotting tools** using, e.g., *matplotlib*, *cartopy*, *Google Earth*, and [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/).
    - compute mean/standard-deviation **pixel intensity** of image patches.

## Installation

### Set up a conda environment

We recommend installation via Anaconda (refer to [Anaconda website and follow the instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)).

* Create a new environment for `mapreader` called `mr_py38`:

```bash
conda create -n mr_py38 python=3.8
```

* Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate mr_py38
```

### Method 1

* Install `mapreader`:

```bash
pip install mapreader 
```

To work with geospatial images (e.g., maps):

```bash
pip install "mapreader[geo]" 
```

* We have provided some [Jupyter Notebooks to showcase MapReader's functionalities](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/MapReader/tree/main/examples). To allow the newly created `mr_py38` environment to show up in the notebooks:

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name mr_py38 --display-name "Python (mr_py38)"
```

* Continue with the examples in [Use cases](#use-cases)!

* ⚠️ On *Windows* and for *geospatial images* (e.g., maps), you might need to do:

```bash
# activate the environment
conda activate mr_py38

# install rasterio and fiona manually
conda install -c conda-forge rasterio=1.2.10
conda install -c conda-forge fiona=1.8.20

# install git
conda install git

# install MapReader
pip install git+https://github.com/Living-with-machines/MapReader.git

# open Jupyter Notebook (if you want to test/work with the notebooks in "examples" directory)
cd /path/to/MapReader 
jupyter notebook
```

### Method 2

* Clone `mapreader` source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Living-with-machines/MapReader.git 
```

* Install:

```bash
cd /path/to/MapReader
pip install -v -e .
```

To work with geospatial images (e.g., maps):

```bash
cd /path/to/MapReader
pip install -e ."[geo]"
```

* We have provided some [Jupyter Notebooks to showcase MapReader's functionalities](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/MapReader/tree/main/examples). To allow the newly created `mr_py38` environment to show up in the notebooks:

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name mr_py38 --display-name "Python (mr_py38)"
```

* Continue with the examples in [Use cases](#use-cases)!

## Use cases

[Tutorials](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/MapReader/tree/main/examples) are organized in Jupyter Notebooks. Follow the hyperlinks on input type names ("Non-Geospatial" or "Geospatial") to read guidance specific to those image types. 

  - [Non-Geospatial](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/MapReader/tree/main/examples/non-geospatial):
      - [classification_mnist](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/MapReader/tree/main/examples/non-geospatial/classification_mnist)
        * **Goal:** train/fine-tune PyTorch CV classifiers on MNIST.
        * **Dataset:** Example images taken from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. 
        * **Data access:** locally stored
        * **Annotations** are done on whole MNIST images, **not** on patches/slices of those images.
        * **Classifier:** train/fine-tuned PyTorch CV models.
      - [classification_plant_phenotype](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/MapReader/tree/main/examples/non-geospatial/classification_plant_phenotype)
        * **Goal:** train/fine-tune PyTorch CV classifiers on plant patches in images (plant phenotyping example).
        * **Dataset:** Example images taken from the openly accessible `CVPPP2014_LSV_training_data` dataset available from https://www.plant-phenotyping.org/datasets-download.
