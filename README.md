## What is MapReader?

MapReader is an end-to-end computer vision (CV) pipeline for analyzing large collections of images/maps. It has two main components: preprocessing/annotation and training/inference:

        alt="MapReader pipeline" width="70%" align="center">
</p>

MapReader provides a set of tools to:

- **load** images/maps stored locally or **retrieve** maps via web-servers (e.g., tileservers which can be used to retrieve maps from OpenStreetMap (OSM), the National Library of Scotland (NLS), or elsewhere). :warning: Refer to the [credits and re-use terms](#credits-and-re-use-terms) section if you are using digitized maps or metadata provided by NLS.
- **preprocess** images/maps (e.g., divide them into patches, resampling the images, removing borders outside the neatline or reprojecting the map).
- annotate images/maps or their patches (i.e. slices of an image/map) using an **interactive annotation tool**.
- **train, fine-tune, and evaluate** various CV models.
- **predict** labels (i.e., model inference) on large sets of images/maps.
- Other functionalities include:
    - various **plotting tools** using, e.g., *matplotlib*, *cartopy*, *Google Earth*, and [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/).
    - compute mean/standard-deviation **pixel intensity** of image patches.

Below is an example of MapReader CV model output (see [the paper on MapReader](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15592) for more details):

    British 'railspace' and buildings as predicted by a MapReader computer vision model. ~30.5M patches from ~16K nineteenth-century Ordnance Survey map sheets were used (courtesy of the National Library of Scotland). (a) Predicted railspace; (b) predicted buildings; (c) and (d) predicted railspace (red) and buildings (black) in and around Middlesbrough and London, respectively. MapReader extracts information from large images or a set of images at a patch level, as depicted in the insets. For both railspace and buildings, we removed those patches that had no other neighboring patches with the same label within a distance of 250 meters.

## Installation for local setup

### Set up a conda environment

We strongly recommend installation via Anaconda:

* Refer to [Anaconda website and follow the instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

* Create a new environment for `mapreader` called `mr_py38`:

```bash
conda create -n mr_py38 python=3.8
```

* Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate mr_py38
```

### Method 1

* Install `mapreader`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Living-with-machines/MapReader.git
```

and to work with maps:

```bash
pip install 'git+https://github.com/Living-with-machines/MapReader.git#egg=MapReader[maps]'
```
* Adding a `ipython` kernel to use in the [Tutorials](#table-of-contents)

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name "<name-of-your-kernel>" --display-name "<Python (my kernel)>"
```
* Continue with the [Tutorials](./examples)!


* ⚠️ On *Windows*, you might need to do:

```bash
# activate the environment
conda activate mr_py38

# install rasterio and fiona manually
conda install -c conda-forge rasterio=1.2.10
conda install -c conda-forge fiona=1.8.20

# install git
conda install git

# install MapReader
pip install git+https://github.com/Living-with-machines/MapReader.git

# open Jupyter Notebook (if you want to test/work with the notebooks in "examples" directory)
cd /path/to/MapReader
jupyter notebook
```

* We have provided some [Jupyter Notebooks to show how different components in MapReader can be run](./examples). To allow the newly created `mr_py38` environment to show up in the notebooks:

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name mr_py38 --display-name "Python (mr_py38)"
```

* Continue with the [Tutorials](#table-of-contents)!

### Method 2

* Clone `mapreader` source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Living-with-machines/MapReader.git
```

* Install:

```bash
cd /path/to/MapReader
pip install -v -e .
```

and to work with maps:

```bash
cd /path/to/MapReader
pip install -e ."[maps]"
```

* Adding a `ipython` kernel to use in the [Tutorials](./examples)

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name "<name-of-your-kernel>" --display-name "<Python (my kernel)>"
```
* Continue with the [Tutorials](./examples)!
